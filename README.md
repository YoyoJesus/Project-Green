# Project-Green

Project Green is a web-app that tracks your ability to recycle and how much you do so. The program rewards you for each item you recycle.

# Reward System
- Wrappers - 1 point
- cans/glass bottles - 2 to 4 based on size
- cardboard - 5 points

# Points Rewards
Points can be redeemed for a variety of block-chain enabled prizes & potentially physical items

# Tracking
We are designing a trashcan lid that tracks the items you recycle, which would use a camera & machine learning combo to track the items thrown out.
